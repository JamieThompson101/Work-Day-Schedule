# Work-Day-Schedule
##Description:

This application follows starter code that has been modified to meet certain acceptance criteria and to act as a work day scheduler. This application includes the usage of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JQuery to ensure in functions properly.


##Motivators:

The motivation behind this project was to see just how much JQuery and JavaScript can effect the interactivity of certain projects. By completing this project, I have learned more about just how useful certain functions in JavaScript can be. Thus, I have honed my JS skills.

##Acceptance criteria:

AS AN employee with a busy schedule

I WANT to add important events to a daily planner

SO THAT I can manage my time effectively

GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule

WHEN I open the planner

THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar

WHEN I scroll down

THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours of 9am to 5pm

WHEN I view the time blocks for that day

THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future

WHEN I click into a time block

THEN I can enter an event

WHEN I click the save button for that time block

THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage

WHEN I refresh the page

THEN the saved events persist
